This is the structure of the project. The `.env` file is used to store environment variables,
`.env.example` is an example of how the `.env` file should look like, `.gitignore` is used to ignore certain files from being tracked by git.
The `api` folder contains the main application code, `main.py` is the entry point of
the application, and `structure.md` is a documentation of the project structure.
The `README.md` file contains information about the project, and `requirements.txt`
lists the dependencies required by the project.
